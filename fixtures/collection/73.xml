<dc:description>The Traditional Use Studies Website explores the history and methodologies for undertaking studies of land use by Aboriginal Peoples. This work involves gathering of information from Elders and other knowledge keepers and creating maps and other documents that make this knowledge accessible. Findings are valuable for a range of purposes from rights protection for Aboriginal Peoples (who conduct the studies), to governments desiring to regulate land use and environmental protection, and industry wishing to exploit resources. Examples are drawn from Alberta, Canada and internationally.</dc:description>
