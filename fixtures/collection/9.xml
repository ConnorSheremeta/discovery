<dc:description>This Edukit introduces students to the traditional Aboriginal practices that are rooted in science. Students will learn how Aboriginal Peoples dyed their clothing using natural substances, such as bark or berries, and what kind of scientific thought and natural materials were used to engineer a canoe. The text is complemented by historical photographs of natural vegetation and tools used by First Nations and MÃ©tis, and it also illustrates the various Native canoe designs. Students are invited to play the educational cross words puzzles and test their knowledge with the quizzes; other activities include crafting their own canoes and dying pieces of fabric.</dc:description>
