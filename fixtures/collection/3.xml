<dc:description>The University of Alberta has much to celebrate after a century of academic excellence and achievement. The University of Alberta Centenary Web Site Project is an online celebration of the University of Alberta and its unique place in Alberta's history. It is a retrospective of the rich history and heritage of the University; a look at university life, culture, and tradition, at what has changed, and at what has remained the same. It is a testament to Albertan ingenuity and innovation; to university research, development, and the discovery of knowledge. It is a multimedia journey through one hundred years of documentation, photographs, video and audio clips, interactive timelines, and memories recounting the story of how the University of Alberta has enriched and changed the world.</dc:description>
