    <more-info>Many topics in the sciences basic to these activities are also covered, including the physiology, biochemistry, ecology, genetics, and biosystematics of the plants, animals, and microorganisms that are indexed as domesticated organisms, genetic resources, pests, pathogens, hosts, or potential economic resources. In human health and medicine, the emphasis is on: human nutrition, community and public health, tropical diseases, communicable diseases including AIDS, medical mycology, entomology, and parasitology.
