<dc:description>Identity, "nation," and "nationalism" are ever-evolving concepts that hold disparate meanings for different people. At the heart of these varied understandings lay diverse historical, geographic, political, economic, and social factors. By exploring past histories and current challenges through a variety of interactive games, text, images, audio and video resources, students at the senior secondary level are invited to learn about concepts that have shaped times of peace and conflict in the Middle East.</dc:description>
