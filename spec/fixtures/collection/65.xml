<dc:description>The French presence in what became Alberta goes back to the earliest period of the fur trade. Edmonton was the heart of that presence. This website documents and explores Edmonton's unique, historic role as Western Canada's second-largest Francophone city (next to Saint-Boniface, Manitoba). Discover Francophone Edmonton through the pages of this dynamic website.</dc:description>
