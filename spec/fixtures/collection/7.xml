<dc:description>The selfless acts of thousands of Albertan volunteers have defined the province since the first explorers entered Western Canada. Find out about the people and the organizations they formed who have dedicated themselves to advancing the causes of others without the expectation of being compensated. Alberta's volunteers are one of our most valuable natural resources, and they have been improving community for over 100 years.</dc:description>
