<dc:description>What is the similarity between Rene Bourque, Theoren Fleury, and Ted Nolan? Not only are they accomplished National Hockey League players, but they also have Aboriginal heritage. From contemporary sports such as hockey, lacrosse, and track and field to traditional activities like powwows, the hoop game, or longball, physical education is an integral element of Aboriginal culture. In this exciting Edukit, students will discover various kinds of Aboriginal games and sports, familiarize themselves with successful Canadian Aboriginal athletes throughout history, and play educational games including crossword puzzles and word-searches.</dc:description>
