The University of Alberta Centenary Web Site Project is an online celebration of the University of Alberta and its unique place in Alberta's history. It is a retrospective of the rich history and heritage of the University; a look at university life, culture, and tradition, at what has changed, and at what has remained the same. It is a testament to Albertan ingenuity and innovation; to university research, development, and the discovery of knowledge. It is a multimedia journey through one hundred years of documentation, photographs, video and audio clips, interactive timelines, and memories recounting the story of how the University of Alberta has enriched and changed the world.</dc:description>

Students will learn how Aboriginal Peoples dyed their clothing using natural substances, such as bark or berries, and what kind of scientific thought and natural materials were used to engineer a canoe. The text is complemented by historical photographs of natural vegetation and tools used by First Nations and Métis, and it also illustrates the various Native canoe designs. Students are invited to play the educational cross words puzzles and test their knowledge with the quizzes; other activities include crafting their own canoes and dying pieces of fabric.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A long-distance runner, World War I veteran, Canada's first Aboriginal police officer and an Olympic athlete, Alex Decoteau is a local hero of legendary proportions. The Alex Decoteau Edukit was created by the Heritage Community Foundation to support the Alex Decoteau Run, developed by the City Centre Education Project in Edmonton. The Project provides inner-city children, many of whom are Aboriginal, with access to a range of activities that are common in middle class schools.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Traditional Use Studies Website explores the history and methodologies for undertaking studies of land use by Aboriginal Peoples. This work involves gathering of information from Elders and other knowledge keepers and creating maps and other documents that make this knowledge accessible. Findings are valuable for a range of purposes from rights protection for Aboriginal Peoples (who conduct the studies), to governments desiring to regulate land use and environmental protection, and industry wishing to exploit resources. Examples are drawn from Alberta, Canada and internationally.</dc:description>
