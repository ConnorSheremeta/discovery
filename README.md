This is the main repository for the University of Alberta Discovery System. The system uses Blacklight, from Stanford University (http://projectblacklight.org/) and the Comfy Mexican Sofa CMS (https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa). The discovey implementation entails a full-scale redesign of the website and search interface. The new design prioritizes discovery and access across our entire range of owned and licensed material, and facilitates access and reuse of that material within a userâ€™s workflow.  More information about the discovery project can be found here: http://ual-discovery.weebly.com/
