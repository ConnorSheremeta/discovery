Discovery Interface for University of Alberta Libraries
=======================================================

This is the code base for the University of Alberta Libraries's
discovery platform. Based on [Project
Blacklight](projectblacklight.org), it uses Ansible for configuration
management, Solr for the search index, Nginx as a proxy server, and
Unicorn as the web server.
